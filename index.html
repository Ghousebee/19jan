        <div><p><h2><u>Strategic Options Development and Analysis (SODA)</u><br></h2></p></div>
<div><p>SODA is a methodology oriented to structure a complex problem with the<br>
support of a reduced number of persons. The basic tools used are: the<br>

<i>cognitive map</i> that helps to identify the objectives of the problem, the <i>key-<br>
ideas</i> that directs the decision process, and the <i>actions</i> to be taken to solve the<br>

problem. An interactive software called COPE-<i>Cognitive Policy Evaluation</i><br>
    is used to give support to the decision process.</p></div><br><br>
 <div><p><h2><u>GDSS</u><br></h2></p></div>
<div><p>Group Decision Support System or GDSS is a system whose design, structure,<br>
and utilization reflect the manner in which members of a group interact to<br>
choose an alternative of decision. The system should have technological<br>

support for communication, file sharing, modeling activities in group, aggregat-<br>
ing individual perspectives to form a group perspective, and other facilities that<br>

permit interaction within the group. The GDSS can encompass all the sectors<br>
of an organization or only certain activity sectors, with the possibility of<br>
expanding the participation of individuals according to the functional level of the<br>
sectors involved. The GDSS is programmed to accept appropriate input data,<br>
to analyze the objectives (such as productivity, profitability, etc.) and to<br>
provide solutions to the selected problems, generating the appropriate reports.</p></div><br><br>
    <div><p>GDSS may be concerned with the problem of communication media richness.<br>
Media richness is defined as the potential information-carrying capacity of a<br>
data-transmission medium. Different types of media, differing in their richness,<br>
may be appropriate for different types of tasks. For instance, according to<br>
Mallach (2000), face-to-face contact is the highest ranked medium in richness,<br>
followed by video conference, audio conference, real-time electronic chat, and<br>
finally, electronic mail. Electronic mail is ranked as the medium with lowest<br>
richness. In the face-to-face contact, GDSS must consider that participants<br>
should be in <i>the same place</i> and they should work <i>at the same time.</i> In the<br>
case of a video, audio conference as well as real-time electronic chat,<br>
participants may be in different places but they should work at the same time.<br>
Using electronic mail, participants may be in different places doing work at<br>
different times.<br><br>
Authors (Mallach, 2000; and Turban & Aronson, 1998 ) report the following<br>
three general types of GDSS:</p></div><br><br>
        <div><p><ul><li><b>Communication Management System:</b></li></ul>provides communication flows<br>
by means of facilities to store and exchange messages. Common examples<br>
of this type of system are the electronic mail packages.<br>

 <ul><li><b>Content Management Systems:</b></li></ul> provides automatic routing of mes-<br>
sages according to the contents in a standardized way.<br>

        <ul><li><b>Process Management Systems:</b></li></ul>provides important aid in both indi-<br>
vidual and group decision making process controlling: the pattern, con-<br>
tents, timing, and flow of the information exchange. Control of pattern and<br>

contents of the message can be made by <i>forms</i> represented by different<br>
types of documents. Control of timing and flow can be made by a <i>script</i><br>
that defines the routing of the form. A Work Flow system, considered as<br>
an “intelligent electronic mail” is an example of this type of GDSS.<br><br>
These different types of GDSS can be used to manage differences of opinion,<br>
focus on the goal of the strategic decision, control the time factor, lead to<br>
objective analysis and judgments. The following Case Study One serves to<br>
illustrate the application of group-decision-making methods.</p></div><br><br>

<center><h2><b><u>Decisions that Depend on the<br>
Behavior of Persons</u></b></h2><br><br></center>

<div>Decision models suppose that the decision maker resolves a problem by<br>
choosing the best alternative in terms of gain or profit. In Decision Analysis<br>
Theory and Game Theory this aspect is rigorously obeyed, even though in the<br>
majority of cases the formulated alternatives are simplified or condensed<br>
versions of the possible states of nature. In real-life problems, we also need to<br>
take into consideration the behavior of the individuals or organizations involved<br>
in the decision. Several authors (Cohen et al., 1972; Takahashi, 1997) present<br>
their research results involving the problem of behavior in decisions.We can<br>

classify decision problems according to the behavior of persons or organization
as:<br>

a. <b>Decision for the Complete Resolution of the Problem.</b> A decision is<br>
made to choose one of the possible alternatives, which proposes to<br>
resolve the problem completely. All decision models from Game Theory<br>
and Decision Analysis pertain to this category.<br>
b. <b>Decision by Oversight.</b> In this case, the decision is made in a superficial<br>
or negligent way without any criteria for analyzing the problem. As an<br>
example, we cite the case of hiring someone without examining their<br>
resume, or without having them tested or submitted to any training.<br>
c. <b>Decision by Flight.</b> Encompasses problems approved (or abandoned)<br>
due to difficulty in appropriately appreciating and resolving them, since<br>
they involve conflicts of interest, lack of objectives, lack of interest, lack<br>
of time, etc. The adoption of changes suggested by an anonymous letter<br>
could serve as an example for this type of decision.<br><br>
These three types of situations can be represented by the garbage can model<br>
shown in the section titled Garbage Can Model.<br><br>
<h2><b><u>Garbage Can Model</u></b></h2><br><br>
The garbage can model proposed by Cohen et al. (1972) pictures the problem<br>
of decision-making as enormous garbage can where problems to be resolved</div><br><br>

<div>are put. Well-structured problems or those with a higher priority are resolved<br>
and taken out of the can. The other problems are taken out after a superficial<br>
examination or are taken out of the can because they are taking up space. Many<br>
neglected problems remain on the bottom of the garbage can, which requires<br>
the periodic emptying.<br>
The garbage can model is made up of the following elements:<br><br><br>
1. <b>Decision Mechanism:</b>is a structure or instance for deciding a problem,<br>
spending a certain amount of ENERGY, according to the difficulty or<br>
interest in resolving this problem. Examples: decision making meetings,<br>

hiring committees, committees for firing or promoting employees, parlia-<br>
ment, congresses, etc.;<br>

2. <b>Participants:</b> are people or organizations that are part of the decision-<br>
making mechanism and spend a certain amount of ENERGY (time,<br>

knowledge, money) to try to resolve a problem;<br>
3. <b>Problems:</b> are proposals presented to the decision mechanism;<br>
4. <b>Solution to the Problem:</b> decision alternatives chosen for each problem.<br>
The occurrence of oversight or flight-type decisions can be linked to the greater<br>
or lesser importance or priority attributed to a problem. These decisions may<br>
occur due to the existence of the phenomenon called organizational anarchy.<br>
According to Cohen et al., organizational anarchy may be the result of the<br>
existence of many problems which are difficult to describe in a precise way.<br>
Some reasons for the existence of organizational anarchy are:<br><br>
1. decision participants lack clarity in defining and selecting problems;<br><br>
2. difficulty in describing and applying a technology or former experience to<br>
the solution of the similar problem;<br><br>
3. existence of multiple restrictions or conditions imposed on the problem<br>
which disperse decision maker’s attention;<br><br>
4. irregular, sporadic, or inadequate participation of persons or group of<br>
persons so that the level of energy available to resolve problems is uneven.<br><br>
Organizational anarchy can be found, for instance, in some university (or some<br>
public agency) where:</div><br><br>
    <div><i>Table 13.1. Some rate of occurrence of decisions of the oversight or flight<br>
type, in different positions and age groups (% and total number of
persons) (adapted from Takahashi, 1997)</i>
        <img src="IMG_20240119_133003.jpg"><br><br>
    1. Several decision-making organisms (schools, departments, committees,<br>
projects, etc.) are created and their problems are thrown in the garbage<br>
can represented by the university.<br>
2. The methods employed (such as teaching, research, evaluation methods,<br>
etc.) provide uncertain results for the development of the university.<br>

3. Professors, students, employees or community representatives partici-<br>
pate in an irregular fashion in the decision making organisms of the<br>

university.<br>
Table 13.1 presents the partial result of a research to evaluate the number of
persons (according to position and age group) that have had experience in
adopting a decision of this type (flight or oversight).<br>
According to this research, high rates of decision by oversight or flight are
observed in the first age intervals for heads of division, department, and
supervisor/managers groups. Inside regular employees, the rate of decision by
flight or oversight increases according to the age interval. Answers from groups
with less than 10 persons were discarded.<br><br><br>

In the behavioral model of decision making, it is important to consider the
behavior of each person or group of persons regarding the psychological</div>
